# Arduino Files for ESP32 Integrated with Sensors
# Overview
This repository contains Arduino sketch files for interfacing an ESP32 microcontroller with various sensors. The code provided here demonstrates how to read data from sensors connected to the ESP32, process the data, and optionally transmit it to other devices or platforms.

# Requirements

  a) Arduino IDE (or compatible IDE such as PlatformIO)
 
  b) ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP-WROOM-32)
  
  c) Sensors compatible with ESP32 (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion sensors)
  
  d) Necessary libraries for sensor interfacing (details provided in individual sketch files)

# Files Included
  
  a) Sketch files (.ino): Each .ino file corresponds to a specific sensor or sensor combination setup.
  
  b) README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.

# Getting Started
  
  a) Setting Up Arduino IDE:
  
      Install the Arduino IDE from Arduino's official website.
      Add support for ESP32 boards in the Arduino IDE (instructions available on the ESP32 GitHub repository).

  b) Installing Libraries:
      
      Ensure all necessary libraries are installed. Library dependencies are listed at the beginning of each .ino file.

  c) Hardware Setup:
      
      Connect your sensors to the ESP32 development board following the wiring diagrams provided in the respective .ino files.
      Verify the pin configurations and adjust if necessary to match your setup.

  d) Uploading and Running the Sketch:
      
      Open the desired .ino file in Arduino IDE.
      Select the correct ESP32 board and COM port.
      Upload the sketch to your ESP32 board.

  e) Monitoring Output:
     
      Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE to view sensor data output.
      Adjust the baud rate as specified in the sketch file for optimal communication.

  f) Customization and Expansion:
      
      Modify the sketch files to suit additional sensors or different data processing requirements.
      Expand functionality by integrating with external platforms or adding more sensors as needed.

# Troubleshooting

  a) If encountering issues during compilation or upload, ensure all libraries are up-to-date and compatible with your ESP32 board.
  
  b) Double-check wiring connections and configurations against the specifications in the .ino file.
