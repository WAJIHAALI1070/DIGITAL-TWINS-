# FLIR Lepton Thermal Camera Integration with ESP32

This repository contains code and instructions for integrating the FLIR Lepton thermal camera breakout v1.4 with an ESP32 microcontroller.

### Project Overview

This project aims to integrate the FLIR Lepton thermal camera breakout v1.4 with an ESP32 microcontroller. The FLIR Lepton is a compact thermal imaging sensor capable of detecting infrared radiation emitted by objects. When integrated with an ESP32, it enables the ESP32 to capture thermal images and process thermal data for various applications.

### Capabilities of FLIR Lepton Camera

The FLIR Lepton thermal camera offers several capabilities:

1. **Infrared Imaging:** It captures thermal infrared radiation emitted by objects in the scene, enabling non-contact temperature measurements.
   
2. **Resolution and Sensitivity:** Despite its small size, FLIR Lepton provides good resolution (e.g., 80x60 pixels) and sensitivity to temperature differences, suitable for detecting heat patterns and anomalies.

3. **Compact and Lightweight:** Its small form factor makes it ideal for integration into portable devices and IoT applications where space is limited.

4. **Integration Flexibility:** Interfaces like SPI and I2C allow easy integration with microcontrollers like ESP32, facilitating real-time data processing and analysis.

### Integration with ESP32

Integrating FLIR Lepton with ESP32 leverages the microcontroller's capabilities:

- **Data Processing:** ESP32 can capture thermal images from FLIR Lepton and process them for various applications such as monitoring, automation, and safety systems.
  
- **IoT Connectivity:** With ESP32's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, thermal data can be transmitted wirelessly for remote monitoring and control.
  
- **Customization:** Developers can customize the firmware to implement specific algorithms for object detection, temperature threshold alerts, and more.

## Example Code

A brief example of code snippet demonstrating how to initialize and read data from the FLIR Lepton thermal camera using ESP32.

```cpp
// Example code snippet
#include <FLIRLepton.h>

// Initialize the FLIR Lepton object
FLIRLepton flir;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // Initialize the FLIR Lepton camera
  if (!flir.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Failed to initialize FLIR Lepton!");
    while (1);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Read and process data from FLIR Lepton
  uint16_t *frame = flir.captureFrame();
  
  // Process the thermal image frame data
  // Example: Display or send data via MQTT, etc.
  
  delay(1000); // Adjust as needed
}
